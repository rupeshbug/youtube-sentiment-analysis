      "2. Guys, guys.\n",
      "3. Such a great cast🤍💍\n",
      "4. Hilarious, even though Matthew Perry's playing the straight man for once. But he was a great actor in general, not just a great comedian.\n",
      "5. 2 mood swing in one scene, amazing!\n",
      "6. Monica Dan Chandler Menikah Kedua\n",
      "7. Ross: Man, this is the most beautiful engagement ring ever.\n",
      "Rachel: Well, you should know, you've bought like a billion of em.\n",
      "Ross: Yyyeah, you didn't get one.\n",
      "8. I love how Monica and Chandler happy ending romance. I believe Matthew Perry and Courtney cox could have been too.\n",
      "9. The ring was beautiful unique ever.\n",
      "10. Matthew looks very unwell here...people really need to understand that as much as this show is loved, it is also incredibly filled with pain behind all the comedy.  Read his book and you'll understand just how much...\n",
      "11. Heheheyyyyy…whattt?!!\n",
      "12. RIP Matthew😭😭 He made us laugh and smile, such a legend. Fly high🕊🕊🕊🕊\n",
      "13. RACHEL IN THIS OUTFIT IS SOOOO SOOO SOOOOOO GORGEOUS\n",
      "14. Why exactly were Joey and Ross mad at Chandler at the start?\n",
      "15. Jennifer's breezy delivery of \"one and a half carat easy\" is underrated lmao\n",
      "16. I think chandler making the right decision to tell pheobe instead of Ross and joey she is a vile and knows what to get\n",
      "17. The reactions to the announcement are so sweet, as is Chandler's sort of self-consciousness when announcing.\n",
      "18. I woulda said yes in a heartbeat ❤❤❤\n",
      "19. Water under a Bridge :)\n",
      "20. We want friends like this who get jealous if we don't tell them our most imp things first\n",

      "29. Its so cute the way chandler says \"guys\" at the end .RIP MATHEW ❤\n",
      "30. I've just finished listening ro Matthew's audiobook, and as much as I want to be sad, and I was. I don't think he would want people to feel sad for him in his death.  I know he didn't want Chandler to be his legacy, because he wanted to be remembered for helping people...But I think he did not realise that by being Chandler he did help people, he made them laugh.. even.. or maybe most especially when they didn't feel like laughing.  He helped them escape for 20 minutes, which I think is pretty amazing.  Though, I can't help but feel sad that he didn't have the time to do all the things he wanted to do, but Matthew.... you inspired so many generations in so many different ways and not many people have that as their legacy.\n",
      "31. Rip its nice to see all you're friends co stars say how much they miss you even though they shunned you during your addiction good job guys\n",

I’ll forever miss you, Matthew Perry! you’re always gonna be in our hearts and I hope you know that you are loved and you made so many people happy. We will continue to honor the legacy you left behind. You’re a fucking legend, man! May you rest in heaven🤍\n",
      "36. We will forever miss you..mat/chandler..RIP\n",
      "37. The cast should have freeze Perry out till he got his act together \n",
      "Apparently they would shoot a season from sept to March then Perry would go get completely wasted either by drinking himself in a stupor or by taking drugs …..\n",
      "38. Dear Reader,\n",
      "I want you to know today that Jesus Christ loves you.\n",
      "The fact is, He loves you so much that He made the ultimate sacrifice for you! You see, God is a perfect, just God who will not tolerate sinful people coming into heaven, and the problem is that we are sinful by nature. No matter how much good we do, it will never be enough to meet God's perfect standard. The good Lord knew this, and He loved us so much that He came down to earth, lived a sinless life, and died to take the sin of the world.\n",
      " Romans 6:23 \"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"\n",
      "All you have to do is ask the Lord to forgive your sin and tell Him that you accept His gift of salvation as the ONLY way to eternal life.\n",

      "46. Season 6 Last two episodes 🥹\n",
